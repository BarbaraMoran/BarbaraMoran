...and I really enjoy coding! 

In the last months I've been studying at the [Adalab bootcamp](https://adalab.es/cursos-desarrollo-web "Adalab's Homepage"), 
where I've learnt the main technologies to start my way as a Front End Developer:

- ðŸŒ  HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox, CSS Grid, SASS, Bootstrap
- ðŸŒ  JavaScript (ES6) and third-party web services (APIs)
- ðŸŒ  Version control with Git
- ðŸŒ  Creation of SPAs with React
- ðŸŒ  Basic knowledge of APIs and back-end programming: applications with Node JS, Express and SQL


ðŸ’œ I am currently working on a personal React project based on traditional memory card games to make female punk pioneers visible (I am a punk singer myself ðŸ˜Ž).
With this project I hope to test my knowledge and learn how to develop new functionalities.

Thanks!!!!!
