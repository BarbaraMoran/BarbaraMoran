...and I really enjoy coding! 


- ðŸŒ  JavaScript (ES6) and third-party web services (APIs)
- ðŸŒ  Creation of SPAs with React 
- ðŸŒ  HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox, CSS Grid, SASS
- ðŸŒ  Version control with Git
- ðŸŒ  Basic knowledge of APIs and back-end programming: applications with Node JS, Express and SQL


ðŸ’œ I am currently working on a [**React project inspired by traditional memory card games**](https://github.com/BarbaraMoran/girls-invented-punk), in order to make female punk pioneers visible (I am a punk singer myself ðŸ˜Ž).
I also hope to test my knowledge and learn to develop new functionalities. ðŸ¤“
